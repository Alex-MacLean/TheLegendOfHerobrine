# TheLegendOfHerobrine
A git hub page for The Legend of Herobrine Minecraft mod

This mod is is early access so if you play with it, expect many crashes, bugs, missing features, and world corruptions.

It is recommended to use the very latest version of forge to avoid issues, as this is what the mod is developed on

It is also recommended to downlaod from the curseforge website, since that is what is updated first, link here: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-legend-of-herobrine
